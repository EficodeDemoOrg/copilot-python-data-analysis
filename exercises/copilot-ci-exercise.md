---

## Exercise Overview

**Goal**: Set up Act to run GitHub Actions locally and optimize CI workflows with Copilot assistance.

**Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate  
**Focus**: DevOps tooling, local development workflows, CI/CD optimization

---

## Phase 1: Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

First, let's confirm your system is ready:

```bash
# Verify Docker is running
docker --version
docker ps

# Verify Git is available
git --version

# Check if you're in the project directory
pwd
ls -la .github/workflows/
```

### Step 2: Act Installation with Copilot

Use Copilot to guide the installation process:

```
@terminal How do I install Act on my operating system to run GitHub Actions locally?

I need to understand:
1. The best installation method for my OS
2. Any additional configuration required
3. How to verify the installation works
```

**Common installation commands** (Copilot will help you choose):
```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install act

# Windows with Chocolatey
choco install act-cli

# Linux (manual download)
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Step 3: Verify Act Installation

```bash
# Check Act version
act --version

# See available workflows
act -l
```

If you encounter issues, use Copilot:
```
Act installation failed with this error: #terminalLastCommand

Help me troubleshoot:
1. What caused this error?
2. What are alternative installation methods?
3. Are there any missing dependencies?
```

---

## Phase 2: Running Local CI Pipeline

### Step 1: Analyze Our Workflow

Let's understand what we're about to run:

```
#file:.github/workflows/ci.yml /explain

Analyze our CI workflow. What will happen when I run this locally with Act? 
- What Docker images will it use?
- Are there any potential issues?
- What should I expect to see?
```

### Step 2: First Act Run (Dry Run)

Always start with a dry run to see what would happen:

```bash
# Dry run - shows what would execute without running it
act -n

# If you want to see more details
act -n -v
```

Use Copilot to understand the output:
```
Act dry run shows this output: #terminalLastCommand

Explain:
1. What Docker images will be downloaded?
2. What steps will be executed?
3. Are there any warnings I should address?
```

### Step 3: Full CI Run

Now let's run the actual CI pipeline:

```bash
# Run the full CI pipeline
act

# If you want to see detailed logs
act -v
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Docker images will be downloaded (this may take a few minutes the first time)
- Python environments will be set up for multiple versions
- Tests, linting, and formatting checks will run

### Step 4: Troubleshooting Common Issues

If the run fails, use Copilot for diagnosis:

```
The Act run failed with this error: #terminalLastCommand

Help me understand and fix:
1. Is this a Docker issue, Python issue, or Act configuration issue?
2. What's the specific cause of this error?
3. How can I resolve this?
4. Are there any Act-specific configurations I need?
```

**Common issues and Copilot queries:**
- Docker image problems: `@terminal explain this Docker pull error #terminalLastCommand`
- Python version issues: `How do I configure Act to use the correct Python versions? #problems`
- Permission issues: `@terminal how to fix Docker permission denied errors #terminalLastCommand`

---

## Phase 3: Optimization and Integration

### Step 1: Create Local Development Commands

Use Copilot to create convenient commands:

```
/new Create a Makefile that uses Act to run different CI jobs locally

I want these commands:
- make test-local: run only the test steps
- make lint-local: run only linting and formatting
- make ci-full: run the complete CI pipeline
- make ci-quick: run a fast subset for development

Use our existing .github/workflows/ci.yml as the base.
```

### Step 2: Act Configuration

Let's optimize Act for our project:

```
How can I create a .actrc file to optimize Act for our Python project? #file:.github/workflows/ci.yml

I want to:
1. Use appropriate Docker images for Python
2. Set up proper environment variables
3. Optimize for faster local development
4. Handle secrets and environment configuration
```

### Step 3: VS Code Integration (Optional)

```
/new Create VS Code tasks.json entries for running Act commands

I want tasks for:
- Running full CI locally
- Running just tests
- Running just linting
- Debugging CI issues

Make them easy to run from VS Code's command palette.
```

## Bonus Challenges üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

If you finish early and want to explore more:

### Challenge 1: Multi-Workflow Support
```
Our project might have multiple workflows in the future. How can I configure Act to handle different types of workflows (CI, deployment, security scans)?
```

### Challenge 2: Custom Docker Images
```
How can I create or configure custom Docker images for Act that include all our project dependencies pre-installed for faster local runs?
```

### Challenge 3: Integration with Git Hooks
```
/new Create a pre-commit hook that runs a subset of our CI checks locally using Act before allowing commits.
```
