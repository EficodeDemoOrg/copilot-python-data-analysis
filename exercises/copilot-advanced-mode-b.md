# GitHub Copilot Exercises: Advanced Track - Mode B (Agent-Driven Development)

Welcome to the agent-driven GitHub Copilot training! This document is designed for developers who want to explore the cutting edge of AI-assisted software development using GitHub Copilot as an autonomous development agent.

**⚠️ Important:** This mode requires a fundamentally different mindset. You are not making wishes—you are providing strategic direction, maintaining oversight, and ensuring quality at every step. The agent executes, but you remain the architect and decision-maker.

## Prerequisites: Setting Up Agent-Driven Development

Before starting any exercises, you must establish a robust foundation for agent collaboration.

### Step 1: Configure Copilot Instructions

Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your project root with comprehensive guidance:

```markdown
# Project-Specific Copilot Instructions

## Development Environment
- Python 3.10+, FastAPI, pandas, pytest
- Use uvicorn for development server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Run tests with: `pytest -v`
- Code formatting with: `black .` and `flake8 .`

## Coding Standards
- Follow PEP 8 with black formatting
- Use type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Implement comprehensive docstrings for all public functions
- Use Pydantic models for API request/response validation
- Follow FastAPI best practices for route organization

## Testing Requirements
- Write tests using pytest with descriptive test names
- Use pytest fixtures for test data and setup
- Implement both unit and integration tests
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test coverage should be >80% for new code

## Git Workflow
- Make small, atomic commits with descriptive messages
- Follow conventional commit format: type(scope): description
- Always run tests before committing
- Create feature branches for significant changes

## Architecture Patterns
- Separate API routes, business logic, and data access
- Use dependency injection for services
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions
- Use async/await for I/O operations where appropriate

## Security Considerations
- Validate all input using Pydantic models
- Implement proper CORS configuration
- Use security headers for production deployment
- Never expose sensitive data in error messages

## Human Interaction Requirements
CRITICAL: Before implementing any significant changes:
1. Confirm understanding of requirements with the human
2. Present implementation plan for approval
3. Ask for clarification on ambiguous requirements
4. Validate architectural decisions before proceeding
```

### Step 2: Initialize Agent Collaboration Session

Start each exercise with this setup:

1. **Environment Validation:**
   ```
   @workspace Please analyze the current project structure and validate it against the copilot-instructions.md. Identify any inconsistencies with the stated coding standards, testing requirements, or architectural patterns. Report your findings before we proceed.
   ```

2. **Capability Assessment:**
   ```
   @workspace Based on the project's current state and my copilot-instructions.md, what are your capabilities and limitations for this development session? What should I be aware of regarding your decision-making process?
   ```

## Agent-Driven Development Workflow

Every exercise follows this structured approach:

### Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis (Use "Ask" Mode)
- Use Copilot Chat to understand the problem space
- Analyze existing code and architecture
- Identify constraints and requirements
- Validate understanding with human oversight

### Phase 2: Specification Creation (Transition to "Agent" Mode)
- Convert discoveries into formal specification documents
- Create persistent, version-controlled documentation
- Establish success criteria and acceptance tests

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning (High-Power Model Recommended)
- Break down implementation into incremental steps
- Create detailed TODO.md for tracking progress
- Plan git commit strategy for each step
- Design comprehensive test strategy

### Phase 4: Iterative Implementation (Agent Mode with Human Oversight)
- Execute implementation in small, tested increments
- Make git commits between logical steps
- Continuously validate against specifications
- Maintain TODO.md tracking

### Phase 5: Thread Management (As Needed)
- Summarize context when threads become congested
- Transfer context to new agents with comprehensive handoffs
- Maintain continuity of specifications and progress tracking

## Exercise 1: Intelligent Refactoring Agent

**Goal:** Use an AI agent to autonomously refactor the application architecture while maintaining full human oversight of strategic decisions.

### Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis

**Human-Led Problem Definition:**
```
@workspace I want to refactor this application for better maintainability and scalability. Please analyze the current architecture focusing on app/main.py and app/data_config.py. 

Before proposing solutions, I need you to:
1. Understand the current coupling between components
2. Identify specific maintainability issues
3. Assess the impact of potential refactoring approaches
4. Confirm your understanding with me before proceeding

Do not suggest solutions yet - first ensure you fully understand the problem space.
```

**Validation Checkpoint:**
After the agent's analysis, validate their understanding:
- Do they correctly identify the monolithic structure issues?
- Have they understood the current API design patterns?
- Are they aware of the existing test structure?
- Do they understand the business logic flow?

### Phase 2: Specification Creation

**Agent-Driven Specification:**
```
@workspace Now that we've established the problem scope, create a comprehensive REFACTOR_SPECIFICATION.md file. This specification must include:

1. Proposed new directory structure with justification
2. Module separation strategy with clear responsibilities
3. API routing architecture using FastAPI APIRouter
4. Data service layer design
5. Test structure reorganization plan
6. Migration strategy that maintains system functionality
7. Success criteria and validation checkpoints

Before writing the specification, confirm with me:
- What are the key architectural principles we should follow?
- What are the non-negotiable requirements for this refactoring?
- What level of risk are we comfortable with during the migration?

Store this specification in the project root for persistent reference.
```

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning

**High-Level Implementation Strategy:**
```
@workspace Based on the approved REFACTOR_SPECIFICATION.md, create a detailed implementation plan:

1. Break down the refactoring into 8-12 incremental steps
2. Design a git commit strategy for each step
3. Create a comprehensive test plan that ensures no functionality is lost
4. Identify dependencies between steps
5. Plan rollback strategies for each phase
6. Create TODO.md to track progress

Each step should be independently testable and reversible. Present this plan for my approval before proceeding with implementation.
```

**Critical Validation:**
- Review the implementation plan step-by-step
- Ensure each step is small enough to be easily debugged
- Confirm the testing strategy is comprehensive
- Validate that rollback procedures are clear

### Phase 4: Iterative Implementation

**Agent Execution with Oversight:**
```
@workspace Execute the implementation plan with these requirements:

1. Implement only one step at a time
2. Run the full test suite after each step
3. Make a git commit after each successful step with descriptive commit messages
4. Update TODO.md to track completed work
5. Ask for validation before proceeding to the next step if any step fails tests
6. Provide a brief summary of what was accomplished in each step

Start with Step 1 from the implementation plan. Do not proceed to Step 2 until I confirm Step 1 is acceptable.
```

**Human Oversight Protocol:**
- Review each completed step before approving the next
- Validate that tests are passing and functionality is preserved
- Check git commits for clarity and atomic changes
- Ensure TODO.md accurately reflects progress

### Phase 5: Thread Management (If Needed)

**Context Transfer Protocol:**
```
@workspace Our conversation thread is getting long. Please create a comprehensive summary including:

1. Original refactoring objectives and requirements
2. Current implementation status from TODO.md
3. Completed steps and their outcomes
4. Next steps in the implementation plan
5. Any issues or decisions that need human input
6. Current state of the codebase and test suite

Format this as THREAD_SUMMARY.md for handoff to a fresh agent.
```
